                Hospitality has always been deeply rooted in Emirati culture.
                Traditionally, nomadic Bedouins welcomed travelers into their
                tents with warmth and generosity, a custom that laid the
                foundation for the UAE’s modern hospitality industry. This rich
                cultural heritage continues to influence holiday homes&apos;
                design and service ethos across the Emirates, blending
                traditional elements with contemporary comforts.
